# Tech Age Mod

Tech Age is a technology mod with 4 development stages:

TA1: Iron Age
Use tools and aids such as coal burners, coal burners, gravel sieves, hammers and hoppers to mine and process the necessary ores and metals.

TA2: Steam Age
Build a steam engine with drive axles and use it to operate your first ore processing machines.

TA3: Oil Age
Find and extract oil, built railways for oil transportation. A power plant provides the necessary electricity for your machines. Electric light illuminates your industrial plants.

TA4: Future Age
Renewable energy sources such as wind, sun and biofuels help you to leave the oil age. With modern technologies and intelligent machines you set out into the future.

Note: With a click on the plus sign you get into the subchapters of this manual.

## Hints

This documentation is available both "ingame" (block construction plan) and on GitHub as MD files.

- Link: https://github.com/joe7575/techage/wiki

The construction plans (diagrams) for the construction of the machines and the pictures are only available in-game.

With Tech Age you have to start over. You can only create TA2 blocks with the items from TA1, for TA3 you need the results from TA2, etc.

In TA2, the machines only run with drive axes.

From TA3, the machines run on electricity and have a communication interface for remote control.

TA4 adds more power sources, but also higher logistical challenges (power lines, item transport).


## Ores and Minerals

Techage adds some new items to the game:

- Meridium - an alloy for the production of luminous tools in TA1
- Usmium - an ore that is mined in TA2 and needed for TA3
- Baborium - a metal that is needed for recipes in TA3
- Petroleum - is needed in TA3
- Bauxite - an aluminum ore that is needed in TA4 to produce aluminum


### Meridium

Meridium is an alloy of steel and mesecons crystals. Meridium ingots can be made with the coal burner from steel and mesecons crystals. Meridium glows in the dark. Tools made of Meridium also light up and are therefore very helpful in underground mining.

### Usmium

Usmium only occurs as nuggets and can only be obtained by washing gravel with the TA2/TA3 gravel washing system.

### Baborium

Baborium is only extracted in underground mining. Baborium can only be found in stone at an altitude between -250 and -340 meters.
Baborium can only be melted in the TA3 Industrial Furnace.

### Petroleum

Petroleum can only be found with the help of the Explorer and extracted with the help of appropriate TA3 machines. See TA3.

### Bauxite

Bauxite is only extracted in underground mining. Bauxite is only found in stone at a height between -50 and -500 meters.
It is required for the production of aluminum, which is mainly used in TA4.
