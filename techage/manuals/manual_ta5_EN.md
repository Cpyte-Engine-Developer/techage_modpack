# TA5: Future

Machines to overcome space and time, new sources of energy and other achievements shape your life.

Experience points are required for the manufacture and use of TA5 machines and blocks. These can only be worked out using the collider from TA4.

## Energy Sources

### TA5 Fusion Reactor (planned)

## Energy Storage

### TA5 Hybrid Storage (planned)

## Logic blocks

## Transport and Traffic

### TA5 Flight Controller

The TA5 Flight Controller is similar to the TA4 Move Controller. In contrast to the TA4 Move Controller, several movements can be combined into one flight route. This flight route can be defined in the input field using several x,y,z entries (one movement per line). The flight route is checked and saved via "Save". In the event of an error, an error message is issued.

With the "Test" button, the flight route with the absolute coordinates is output for checking in the chat.

The maximum distance for the entire flight distance is 500 m.

The use of the TA5 Flight Controller requires 40 experience points.

### TA5 Hyperloop Chest

The TA5 Hyperloop Chest allows objects to be transported over a Hyperloop network.

The TA5 Hyperloop Chest has to be placed on a Hyperloop Junction. The chest has a special menu, with which you can pair two chests. Things that are in the chest are teleported to the remote station. The chest can also be filled/emptied with a pusher.

For pairing you first have to enter a name for the chest on one side, then you can select this name for the other chest and thus connect the two blocks.

The use of the TA5 Hyperloop Chest requires 20 experience points.

### TA5 Hyperloop Tank

The TA5 Hyperloop Tank allows liquids to be transported over a Hyperloop network.

The TA5 Hyperloop Tank has to be placed on a Hyperloop Junction.The tank has a special menu, with which you can pair two tanks. Liquids in the tank will be teleported to the remote station. The tank can also be filled/emptied with a pump.

For pairing you first have to enter a name for the tank on one side, then you can select this name for the other tank and thus connect the two blocks.

The use of the TA5 Hyperloop Tank requires 20 experience points.

## Teleport Blocks

Teleport blocks allow things to be transferred between two teleport blocks without the need for a pipe or tube in between. To pair the blocks, you first have to enter a name for the block on one side, then you can select this name for the other block and thus connect the two blocks. Pairing can only be carried out by one player (player name is checked) and must be completed before the server is restarted. Otherwise the pairing data will be lost.

The map on the right shows how the blocks can be used.

### TA5 Teleport Block Items

These teleport blocks allow the transfer of items and thus replace a tube. Distances of up to 200 blocks can be bridged.

Each Teleport blocks requires 12 ku of electricity.

60 experience points are required to use the teleport blocks.

### TA5 Teleport Block Liquids

These teleport blocks allow the transfer of liquids and thus replace a pipe. Distances of up to 200 blocks can be bridged.

Each Teleport blocks requires 12 ku of electricity.

60 experience points are required to use the teleport blocks.

### Hyperloop Teleport Blocks (planned)

The Hyperloop Teleport Blocks allow the construction of a Hyperloop network without Hyperloop tubes.

The use of the Hyperloop Teleport Blocks requires 120 experience points.



## More TA5 Blocks/Items

### TA5 Container (planned)

The TA5 container allows Techage systems to be packed and unpacked at another location.

80 experience points are required to use the TA5 container.

### TA5 AI Chip

The TA5 AI Chip is partly required for the production of TA5 blocks. The TA5 AI Chip can only be manufactured at the TA4 Electronics Fab. This requires 10 experience points.
